# sol4debt

Sol4debt provides an easy way to track all types of debts, their costs, risks, and potential solutions in software
projects.
Our goal is to give teams and management a clear, understandable overview of existing debts and their impacts, as well
as transparently present the savings from solutions to facilitate informed and economically sound decisions.
It is inspired by aim42's debt management approach.
